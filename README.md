# RAG-Medical-Chatbot

Welcome to RAG-Medical-Chatbot — a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project focused on building a medical question-answering chatbot. The repository contains Google Colab notebooks (interactive Colab notebooks) that demonstrate data ingestion, embedding, retrieval, and generation pipelines for medically-oriented QA. This README explains how to run the project using Google Colab, required configuration, and important safety considerations.

## Overview
This project demonstrates a RAG pipeline for answering medical questions by:
1. Indexing medical documents (papers, guidelines, FAQs).
2. Creating dense vector embeddings (e.g., sentence-transformers).
3. Retrieving relevant passages with a vector store (FAISS or similar).
4. Conditioning a generative model on retrieved contexts to produce answers.

All experiments and step-by-step code are provided as Google Colab notebooks for easy reproducibility and GPU access.

## Key Features
- End-to-end RAG pipeline implemented in Colab.
- Example notebooks for ingestion, embedding, retrieval, and generation.
- Instructions for using FAISS or other vector stores in Colab.
- Guidance for using local or cloud-hosted generative models (Hugging Face, OpenAI, etc.).
- Notes on data handling and privacy for medical information.

## Colab-first Usage

### Open in Colab
1. Open the notebook file (.ipynb) in this repo on GitHub.
2. Click "Open in Colab" (or prepend `https://colab.research.google.com/github/<owner>/<repo>/blob/main/<notebook>.ipynb`).

Example:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/21J41A0449/RAG-Medical-Chatbot/blob/main/your_notebook.ipynb

### Runtime & Hardware
- Set Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator → GPU (recommended) or TPU if supported by your model.
- Use at least 12+ GB RAM for larger embedding/model tasks; consider Colab Pro/Pro+ if needed.

### Typical Setup Cells
Run the first cells to install dependencies and configure environment, for example:
```python
# Install required packages (run in a Colab cell)
!pip install -q sentence-transformers faiss-cpu transformers datasets accelerate
# For GPU use, install faiss-gpu if available and compatible
# !pip install faiss-gpu
```

### Mounting Google Drive & Saving Artifacts
To persist datasets, indexed vectors, or model checkpoints:
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
# Change to a working directory in your Drive
%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/RAG-Medical-Chatbot
```
Save or load large files from `/content/drive/MyDrive/...` to avoid losing data when the Colab session ends.

## Dependencies
Typical packages used in notebooks (install via pip in Colab):
- python >= 3.8
- sentence-transformers
- faiss-cpu (or faiss-gpu)
- transformers
- datasets
- accelerate (for model inference/training)
- scikit-learn, numpy, pandas
- faiss or alternative vector DBs (Weaviate, Milvus, Pinecone for production)

Install example:
```bash
!pip install sentence-transformers faiss-cpu transformers datasets accelerate
```

## Configuration
- API keys / tokens: If using Hugging Face Hub, OpenAI, or other hosted models, set keys as environment variables or use Colab secrets.
  Example:
  ```python
  import os
  os.environ['HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN'] = "hf_xxx"
  ```
- Notebook cells will indicate where to provide model paths, dataset paths, and retrieval parameters (k, chunk size, etc.).

## Data & Models
- Provide your own medical documents or use public datasets where licensing allows.
- Recommended embedding models: sentence-transformers (e.g., all-MiniLM or larger domain-specific models).
- Generative models: Hugging Face hosted models or API-based models (ensure model size fits Colab GPU memory).
- Vector store choices:
  - FAISS (local in-memory) — good for experiments.
  - Managed vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus) — better for production / large datasets.

## Medical Safety & Privacy
- This project is for research and prototyping. The chatbot is NOT a substitute for professional medical advice.
- Do not use in production for clinical decision-making without rigorous evaluation and oversight.
- Protect personally identifiable information (PII) and comply with applicable healthcare data regulations (HIPAA, GDPR) before uploading private data to any cloud service.

## Project Structure
- Notebooks (*.ipynb): Step-by-step Colab notebooks for each stage (ingest, embed, index, query).
- /data or instructions in notebooks: information about dataset formats and locations.
- /notebooks: (if present) modular notebooks for components.

## Contributing
Contributions, bug reports, and improvements are welcome. Please:
1. Open an issue describing the change.
2. Submit a pull request with clear notes and reproducible examples (Colab links preferred).
